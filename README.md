📊 Trend Analysis Project
📌 Overview

This project analyzes trading activity in relation to market sentiment (Fear vs. Greed).
It leverages historical trading records and a Fear/Greed index dataset, merges them by date, and explores how sentiment impacts:

Trade frequency

Profit/Loss (PnL) behavior

Trading volume patterns

Hourly/daily trends

The analysis is performed in Python (Jupyter Notebook) and results are presented with statistical tests and visualizations.

⚙️ Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/trend-analysis.git
cd trend-analysis

2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # On Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate       # On Windows

3. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt


requirements.txt should include (adjust versions as per your environment):

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scipy
jupyter

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook


Open Trend_Analysis.ipynb and run all cells sequentially.

📊 Features

Data Cleaning & Merging – Combines trade and sentiment datasets into a unified format.

Feature Engineering – Aggregates trade data into hourly summaries.

Statistical Analysis – t-tests assess significance of differences across sentiment regimes.

Visualizations – Time-series, bar charts, boxplots, and heatmaps illustrate key insights.

Report Generation – Exports a professional PDF report with findings and graphs.

📝 Notes

Ensure datasets (trades.csv and fear_greed.csv) are available inside the data/ directory before running the notebook.

All timestamps are assumed to be in IST (adjust if required).

Some graphs (e.g., heatmaps, time series) may require higher resolution screens for clarity.

The project is designed for exploratory and analytical purposes; extend it for predictive modeling if needed.

🚀 Future Enhancements

Automate report generation directly from the notebook.

Add machine learning models to predict sentiment from trading patterns.

Deploy an interactive dashboard (e.g., with Streamlit or Dash).
